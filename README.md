Welcome!
===================


This is your Android challenge as part of the Zenjob interview process. This repository should contain all necessary information to solve the tasks. 
As part of your challenge you will develop a simple Android Application in **Kotlin** and an additional library set of your choice.


Challenge Overview
-------------

Our intern created a demo application that fetches a list of movies from an API, shows it and on click opens 
a detail screen for the given movie. Since he just started Android development the project does not follow the 
Android Best Practices or Material Guidelines. 

It is up to you to bring the project and / or UI to a more senior level.

Requirements
-------------

The demo application uses the free [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3). In order to use it you need to create a TMDB Account and add the API Key to the App.


Engineering Requirements
-------------

Feel free to use any frameworks/ libraries / architecture paradigms you want. The project is just a starting point so you can save time and don't have to 
do the basic setup yourself. The only real requirement is to use Kotlin.




Tasks
-------------

**Mandatory tasks:**
1. Make the App runnable, List screen and detail screen should work.
2. Setup Dependency Injection
3. Migrate the network call from RxJava to Kotlin Coroutines
4. Enhance the Movie List and detail screen by adding images
5. Add Unit & UI Tests
6. Fix code smells/bad usages that you see

*Please add a readme file by writing a few words about what you did in terms of architecture of the app, used frameworks.*

**Notes**
- The challenge is time-boxed to a maximum of 3 hours, please be fair to others and your own schedule and try adhere to it
- Focus on what you're good at or what you want to learn anyway, don't get hung up on a task for too long
- Showoff where you can and want :D 

***Good luck and have fun with the challenge!***

Changes
-------------
1. Added clean architecture with mvvm
2. Used paging library for paging
3. Added Hilt and Coroutines
4. Updated UI   
5. Test cases
